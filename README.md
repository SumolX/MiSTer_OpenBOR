# MiSTer_OpenBOR
A port of OpenBOR v3.1 for the MiSTer platform.  A newer versions of OpenBOR do exist, however the OpenBOR team long ago deprecated SDL1.2 (rightfully so).  This means compatibility with MiSTer video framebuffer via SDL2 is not possible.  Thus I ported an older version which supports a huge collection of Game Modules.  This was done as a gift to my daugher who is a huge fan of Sailor Moon and there are a few Modules available for OpenBOR.

Installer:
     
      Install_OpenBOR.sh

Modules:

      /media/fat/OpenBOR/Paks

Execute:

      MiSTer main menu
      Select scripts
      Select OpenBOR.sh

Update Controls:

      Press Start
      Options
      Control Options...
      Setup Player 1...
      Assign Buttons and select OK
      Repeat for other Players/Gamepads
