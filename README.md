# MiSTer_OpenBOR
This release of OpenBOR for the MiSTer platform was based on my original v3.0 Build 3743 source code.  However, this build is NOT officially supported by the OpenBOR team as it was a personal port for myself and my daughter and any issues encountered should only be reported here.

Newer versions of OpenBOR do exist, however the OpenBOR team deprecated SDL 1.2 (and rightfully so).  This means compatibility with MiSTer video framebuffer via SDL2 is not possible.  Thus I ported an older version which still supports a huge collection of Game Modules.

Support the OpenBOR Team by visiting https://www.chronocrash.com which is the official homepage of the OpenBOR game engine and game makers!

This port is a gift to my daugher who is a huge fan of Sailor Moon and there are quite a few Modules available for OpenBOR!

## OpenBOR
OpenBOR is a continuation of the Beats Of Rage 2D game engine, which was originally
created by the wonderful folks over at http://www.senileteam.com.

## Official Site & Source Code

## History
In 2004, Senile Team released Beats of Rage, a free beat-'em-up for DOS inspired 
by SEGA's Streets of Rage series and using sprites from SNK Playmore's King of 
Fighters series.  The game spread only by word of mouth, but it nonetheless 
amassed popularity very quickly.  Senile Team soon released an edit pack allowing 
anyone interested to create a mod for the BOR engine.

In 2005, Kirby2000 asked Senile Team to open the source code to BOR.  They 
agreed, and OpenBOR was born.  Development on the engine was continued by the 
community, and still is to this day.

## Available Platforms
OpenBOR has a very modular and portable design inherited from Beats of Rage. Ports 
to the following platforms are currently supported:

* Windows
* Linux
* Mac OS X
* Wii
* Android
